DSA: Started the day off with just theory, learnt about how memory is stored in RAM, learnt all about static and dynamic arrays, time complexity for operations in these arrays and also learnt about stacks. 
No code just yet, just theory. I'm not sure if this is the right approach but this is what I am doing.

ML: Then I switched over to learning Linear Algebra, practiced scalar multiplication, adding vectors in magnitude and direction form, parametric representation of lines, linear combination & span, linear independence
and I need to start linear subspaces tomorrow

again, I am not sure if I need all of this stuff for my end goal of becoming an ML enginner (esp the parametric representation of lines part) but this is all good to know.

Also, I started with the Odin Project because I want to learn JavaScript, I just started that and I will continue with it tomorrow :)
